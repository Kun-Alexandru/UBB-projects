14.a. Define a predicate to determine the longest sequences of consecutive even numbers (if exist more maximal sequences one of them).b. For a heterogeneous list, 
formed from integer numbers and list of numbers, define a predicate to replace every sublist with the longest sequences of even numbers from that sublist.Eg.: 
[1, [2, 1, 4, 6, 7], 5, [1, 2, 3, 4], 2, [1, 4, 6, 8, 3], 2, [1, 5], 3] =>[1, [4, 6], 5, [2], 2, [4, 6, 8], 2, [], 3]
