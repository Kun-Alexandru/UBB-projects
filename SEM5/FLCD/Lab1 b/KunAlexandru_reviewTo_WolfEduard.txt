Lab2 review from Kun Alexandru


lexic.txt

- the language's clarity and simplicity make it easy to understand, reducing the learning curve for users
- the lexic is very metodical, making it very easy to grasp, which is essential for developers and language users
- the file is very easy to follow
- you forgot to mention "else", "print" and "while" in the reserved keywords


syntax.in

- the fact that the syntax combines languages such as python and javascript makes it very friendly for the programmer; adding the rigorousness of C++ is the cherry on top 
- the document is very easy to follow, making it very good for programmers that want to learn the basics of this language 
- syntax.in doesn't look to have any mistakes


token.in

- putting a single element on a line makes it very easy to read
- some elements are missing such as "_", "a-zA-z0-9", "while"


I like the language overall. Learning it looks to be very easy for beginners and people that are already familiar with the most popular existing languages.
