-If the user confirms the delete action, the task is removed from the list.


4.Persistence details

-Local db: Task Trifle will maintain a local database to store task-related data. This local database ensures that users can access their tasks even when they are offline. It should support all the CRUD operations, allowing the app to create, read, update, and delete tasks using the locally stored data.
-Server: Task Trifle will be connected to a remote server to provide both online access to the app. When the user is online, the app communicates with the server to retrieve and update the corresponding data.


5.What is happening when the device is offline

-In situations where the user finds themselves without an internet connection, Task Trifle offers a robust offline functionality. Users can create, modify, and remove tasks locally, with all changes being stored within the device's local database. When a task is created while offline, it remains exclusively on the user's device, waiting for synchronization with the server. In offline mode, users can access and work with their tasks, viewing and editing them based on the information previously saved locally.

-If the application is used on offline mode, here is how each operation is dealt with:
 @create: the created entities will be stored on the local device (but not added on the server until the app is used on online mode)
 @read: the operation will show all the entities that are saved on the local device, user can interact with them
 @update: the modified entities will have the changes stored no the local device (but not modified on the server until the app is used on online mode)
 @delete: the deleted entities will be deleted from the local device (but not removed on the server until the app is used on online mode)

-As users interact with Task Trifle while offline, any updates to tasks are applied only within the local database, not affecting the server's data. If a task is deleted while offline, it is removed from the local device but remains intact on the server until an internet connection is reestablished. Once the application regains an online status, all changes made locally are automatically transmitted to the server, ensuring seamless synchronization. Task Trifle aims to provide uninterrupted task management, enabling users to work with the data saved on their device until they regain internet access, at which point the changes are communicated to the central server.
